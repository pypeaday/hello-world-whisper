00:00.000 --> 00:07.000
Girls.

00:07.160 --> 00:12.160
Mal!

00:12.800 --> 00:22.000
Dad!

00:22.000 --> 00:29.000
Louis!

00:29.000 --> 00:32.000
Happy birthday!

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Oh wow! Thanks girls!

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Ah, down, down, stay!

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
We're going to make you breakfast in bed.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Oh great! Just a friendly question.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Don't worry, it won't take long.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Oh thanks!

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Because we know how you get when you're hungry.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Cranky.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.000
Stay.

00:52.000 --> 00:54.000
Alright, here's the plan.

00:54.000 --> 00:55.000
All make dad an omelet.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.000
Louis, you set the breakeye tray and bingo, you make the birthday card.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Quickly, we don't want dad getting hungry.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Okay!

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Okay, super quick omelet.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
Nice specialty.

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
Oh, hi Bingo.

01:07.000 --> 01:08.000
Hi.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Are you going to get started on the birthday card?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I already made one at Kindie.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Oh, that's lovely.

01:15.000 --> 01:18.000
I want to help you make the omelet.

01:18.000 --> 01:20.000
Oh, that's lovely.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
This episode of Louis is called omelet.

01:23.000 --> 01:25.000
What do we do first?

01:25.000 --> 01:27.000
Well, first we need to mix.

01:27.000 --> 01:29.000
Oh, no, I can get them.

01:29.000 --> 01:30.000
Okay.

01:30.000 --> 01:32.000
Oh, bingo!

01:32.000 --> 01:34.000
That's lovely.

01:34.000 --> 01:38.000
Come here and use.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Not you, Celery.

01:40.000 --> 01:42.000
I'll get that.

01:42.000 --> 01:43.000
Oh, huh.

01:43.000 --> 01:45.000
Do you want me to carry those for you?

01:45.000 --> 01:47.000
No, it's like this.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I'm almost there.

01:49.000 --> 01:50.000
Oops.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
It's okay.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
I'll clean it up.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
No, I can do it.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Okay, here's the paper towels.

01:56.000 --> 01:58.000
And...

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I'll make a start on the omelet, honey.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I'll just crack the eggs.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Can I help crack the eggs?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Sure, honey.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
How about I sort this out and you get started on the eggs?

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Grab a silver bowl from the cupboard.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Okay.

02:12.000 --> 02:17.000
Is this one okay?

02:17.000 --> 02:20.000
Oh, man.

02:20.000 --> 02:22.000
I'm getting hungry.

02:22.000 --> 02:29.000
How many eggs do I need on the omelet?

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Um, three or four?

02:30.000 --> 02:31.000
I'm hungry.

02:31.000 --> 02:33.000
Better make it four.

02:33.000 --> 02:38.000
One, two, three.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.000
Come on, bingo.

02:39.000 --> 02:40.000
Okay, polka.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.000
Oh, no.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
One, two, three.

02:43.000 --> 02:46.000
Hey, where's four?

02:46.000 --> 02:47.000
Done.

02:47.000 --> 02:50.000
How are the eggs doing, bingo?

02:50.000 --> 02:52.000
Oh, there's four.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.000
Hello, is Grecky almost ready?

02:55.000 --> 02:56.000
It's coming.

02:56.000 --> 02:59.000
Okay, birthday boy's getting cranky.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.000
Let's get cracking, bingo.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Get it!

03:02.000 --> 03:03.000
Crack it.

03:03.000 --> 03:04.000
Sorry, blowing.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
It's okay.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
I'll clean it up.

03:06.000 --> 03:07.000
Thanks, blowing.

03:07.000 --> 03:09.000
I'll try again, honey.

03:09.000 --> 03:10.000
I'll just hold it for you.

03:10.000 --> 03:11.000
It's hot, honey.

03:11.000 --> 03:12.000
Get a good whack.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.000
Ah!

03:13.000 --> 03:14.000
That's too hot.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.000
Oh, no, honey.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
The shelves don't go in.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.000
Let's try again.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.000
Okay.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.000
Hello?

03:20.000 --> 03:21.000
Hi.

03:21.000 --> 03:26.000
Uh, we'll breakfast be in my mouth soon.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.000
It's on its way.

03:28.000 --> 03:30.000
I'm just letting bingo help me.

03:30.000 --> 03:32.000
I don't want to complain, darling.

03:32.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm just going to help you.

03:35.000 --> 03:36.000
Help me.

03:36.000 --> 03:37.000
I don't want to complain, darling.

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Ah!

03:38.000 --> 03:39.000
Sorry!

03:39.000 --> 03:40.000
Who said my breakfast?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.000
That was a big one.

03:42.000 --> 03:43.000
I got to go.

03:43.000 --> 03:46.000
Bingo, I might handle the omelette, honey.

03:46.000 --> 03:48.000
Oh, you don't want my help.

03:48.000 --> 03:52.000
Um, I do, but it might be quicker if I do it.

03:52.000 --> 03:54.000
Uh, okay.

03:54.000 --> 03:56.000
Why don't you help Bluey set the breakfast tray?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I don't need help, I'm finished.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.000
Well, um...

04:00.000 --> 04:02.000
Oh, look, bingo.

04:02.000 --> 04:04.000
You can play with the salt and pepper soldiers.

04:04.000 --> 04:05.000
You love them.

04:05.000 --> 04:08.000
Okay, mama.

04:08.000 --> 04:11.000
It's coming!

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Bluey, run this celery up to dad.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes, mom.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Okay.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Extra super quick omelette.

04:18.000 --> 04:20.000
Also my specialty.

04:29.000 --> 04:31.000
All right, omelette, done.

04:31.000 --> 04:33.000
Where you going?

04:33.000 --> 04:35.000
I'm off to guard the queen.

04:35.000 --> 04:36.000
That's my job.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
Ooh, I'll come too.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
No, you can't guard the queen.

04:40.000 --> 04:41.000
Why not?

04:41.000 --> 04:42.000
You're not good at it.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I am, really, I am.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
No, you better stay at home.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
But I'm a guard just like you.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Yes, but you're not a fluffer guard, like me.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Oh, okay then.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Bye!

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Bye!

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Hello, queen.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.000
Oh, hello.

05:03.000 --> 05:05.000
The number you have dialed has been disconnected.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.000
Hey, what?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.000
Bingo, come here.

05:10.000 --> 05:12.000
I made an omelette for dad.

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
But I didn't make it the right way.

05:15.000 --> 05:16.000
Really?

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Yeah.

05:17.000 --> 05:20.000
I need your help making another one.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Okay!

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Is that an omelette I can smell?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Get back up, kids!

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
It is!

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Can I choose?

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
No, this isn't fair.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
What?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
What is it for?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
You go.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I'll take care of that.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Please!

05:32.000 --> 05:34.000
I need food.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.000
Maybe I could eat this plant.

05:58.000 --> 06:01.000
I think I'm supposed to eat this.

06:01.000 --> 06:02.000
Sure is!

06:02.000 --> 06:04.000
I made you a omelette.

06:04.000 --> 06:05.000
Give it to me!

06:05.000 --> 06:07.000
No, no, no, no, no, no.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.000
Damn it, Bingo, you're putty.

06:09.000 --> 06:10.000
Please, please, please.

06:10.000 --> 06:13.000
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

06:13.000 --> 06:16.000
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

06:16.000 --> 06:19.000
Maybe I could eat this plant.

06:19.000 --> 06:21.000
I think I'm supposed to eat this plant.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
It's an infusion!

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Sure is!

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
I made you a omelette.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.000
I'm going to have a bite.

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Look, look, look.

06:28.000 --> 06:30.000
Ah!

06:30.000 --> 06:32.000
Did you like it?

06:32.000 --> 06:35.000
Bingo, I'm going to be completely honest.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.000
That was the best omelette I've ever had in my life.

06:38.000 --> 06:39.000
Hey!

06:39.000 --> 06:41.000
Can I have another one?

06:41.000 --> 06:42.000
Yes!

06:42.000 --> 06:44.000
Let me clean this away for you, birthday boy.

06:44.000 --> 06:46.000
No, Mom, I can do it.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.000
Oh, okay.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.000
Thanks, Bingo.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.000
I'll help you.

06:49.000 --> 06:50.000
Thank you.

06:50.000 --> 06:56.000
I think there are a few eggshells in that omelette.

06:56.000 --> 07:00.000
Well, you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs.

07:00.000 --> 07:02.000
We'll clean it up!

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
Eggs.
