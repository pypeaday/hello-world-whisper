00:00.000 --> 00:01.000
Mom!

00:06.000 --> 00:07.000
Dad!

00:12.000 --> 00:13.000
Bingo!

00:18.000 --> 00:19.000
Roo-ray!

00:19.000 --> 00:20.000
Bingo!

00:24.000 --> 00:25.000
Roo-ray!

00:30.000 --> 00:32.000
Happy birthday!

00:32.000 --> 00:34.000
Oh wow, thanks girls.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.000
Down, down, stay.

00:37.000 --> 00:40.000
We're going to make you breakfast in bed.

00:40.000 --> 00:43.000
Oh great, just a friendly question.

00:43.000 --> 00:45.000
Don't worry, it won't take long.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.000
Oh thanks.

00:46.000 --> 00:48.000
Because we know how you get when you're hungry.

00:48.000 --> 00:50.000
Cranky.

00:50.000 --> 00:51.000
Stay.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.000
Alright, here's the plan.

00:53.000 --> 00:58.000
I'll make Dad an omelette, Louie you set the brekkie tray and Bingo you make the birthday card.

00:58.000 --> 01:00.000
Quickly, we don't want Dad getting hungry.

01:00.000 --> 01:01.000
Okay!

01:01.000 --> 01:03.000
Okay, super quick omelette.

01:03.000 --> 01:05.000
My specialty.

01:05.000 --> 01:06.000
Oh, hi Bingo.

01:06.000 --> 01:07.000
Hi.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.000
Are you going to get started on the birthday card?

01:11.000 --> 01:13.000
I already made one at kindy.

01:13.000 --> 01:15.000
Oh, that's lovely.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.000
I want to help you make the omelette.

01:17.000 --> 01:20.000
Oh, that's lovely.

01:20.000 --> 01:23.000
This episode of Louie is called Omelette.

01:23.000 --> 01:24.000
What do we do first?

01:24.000 --> 01:26.000
Well, first we need to mix.

01:26.000 --> 01:28.000
Oh no, I can get them.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.000
Oh, okay.

01:30.000 --> 01:34.000
Bingo, that's awfully loud honey.

01:36.000 --> 01:38.000
Come here, engees.

01:38.000 --> 01:40.000
Not you, celery.

01:40.000 --> 01:41.000
I'll get that.

01:41.000 --> 01:44.000
Oh, do you want me to carry those for you?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.000
No, it's a case.

01:46.000 --> 01:47.000
It's a case.

01:47.000 --> 01:49.000
I'm almost there.

01:50.000 --> 01:51.000
Oops.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.000
It's okay, I'll clean it up.

01:52.000 --> 01:54.000
No, I can do it.

01:54.000 --> 01:56.000
Okay, here's the paper towels.

01:57.000 --> 01:58.000
And up.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.000
I'll make a start on the omelette, honey.

02:00.000 --> 02:02.000
I'll just crack the eggs.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.000
Can I help crack the engees?

02:04.000 --> 02:05.000
Um, sure honey.

02:05.000 --> 02:09.000
How about I sort this out and you get started on the eggs.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.000
Grab a silver bowl from the cupboard.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.000
Okay.

02:12.000 --> 02:14.000
Is this one okay?

02:16.000 --> 02:19.000
Oh man, getting hungry.

02:24.000 --> 02:26.000
How many eggs are in an omelette?

02:26.000 --> 02:27.000
Um, three or four?

02:27.000 --> 02:29.000
I'm hungry.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Better make it four.

02:30.000 --> 02:35.000
One, two, three.

02:35.000 --> 02:37.000
Come on Bingo, be quicker.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.000
Oh no.

02:38.000 --> 02:41.000
One, two, three.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.000
Hey, where's four?

02:43.000 --> 02:44.000
Done.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.000
How are the eggs doing Bingo?

02:46.000 --> 02:48.000
There's four.

02:48.000 --> 02:51.000
Hello, is Brekkie almost ready?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.000
It's coming.

02:52.000 --> 02:54.000
Okay, birthday boy's getting cranky.

02:54.000 --> 02:56.000
Let's get cracking Bingo.

02:56.000 --> 02:58.000
Ah, get it cracking.

03:00.000 --> 03:01.000
Oh my goodness.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.000
Sorry Bluey.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.000
It's okay, I'll clean it up.

03:04.000 --> 03:05.000
No, it's okay.

03:05.000 --> 03:06.000
Sorry Bluey.

03:06.000 --> 03:08.000
It's okay, I'll clean it up.

03:08.000 --> 03:09.000
Thanks Bluey.

03:09.000 --> 03:11.000
Try again honey.

03:11.000 --> 03:13.000
I'll just hold it for you.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.000
Bit harder honey.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.000
Give it a good whack.

03:17.000 --> 03:19.000
That's too high.

03:19.000 --> 03:23.000
Oh, no honey, the shells don't go in.

03:23.000 --> 03:24.000
Let's try again.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.000
Okay.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.000
Hello?

03:28.000 --> 03:29.000
Hi.

03:29.000 --> 03:32.000
Uh, will breakfast be in my mouth soon?

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
It's on its way.

03:33.000 --> 03:35.000
I'm just letting Bingo help me.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.000
I don't want to complain but...

03:37.000 --> 03:38.000
Sorry.

03:38.000 --> 03:40.000
Was that my breakfast?

03:40.000 --> 03:41.000
That was a big one.

03:41.000 --> 03:42.000
I gotta go.

03:43.000 --> 03:45.000
Bingo, I might handle the omelette honey.

03:45.000 --> 03:47.000
Oh, you don't want my help?

03:47.000 --> 03:51.000
Um, I do, but it might be quicker if I do it.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.000
Uh, okay.

03:53.000 --> 03:56.000
Why don't you help Bluey set the breakfast tray?

03:56.000 --> 03:58.000
I don't need help, I'm finished.

03:58.000 --> 03:59.000
Oh.

03:59.000 --> 04:01.000
Well, um, oh look Bingo.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.000
You could play with the Salt and Pepper Soldiers.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.000
You love them.

04:05.000 --> 04:06.000
Okay, Mama.

04:09.000 --> 04:11.000
It's coming.

04:11.000 --> 04:14.000
Bluey, run this celery up to Dad.

04:14.000 --> 04:15.000
Yes, Mom.

04:15.000 --> 04:16.000
Okay.

04:16.000 --> 04:18.000
Extra super quick omelette.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
Also my specialty.

04:19.000 --> 04:21.000
Alright, omelette done.

04:21.000 --> 04:23.000
Where are you going?

04:23.000 --> 04:25.000
I'm off to guard the Queen.

04:25.000 --> 04:26.000
That's my job.

04:26.000 --> 04:27.000
Oh, I'll come too.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.000
No, you can't guard the Queen.

04:29.000 --> 04:30.000
Why not?

04:30.000 --> 04:32.000
You're not good at it.

04:32.000 --> 04:34.000
I am, really I am.

04:34.000 --> 04:36.000
No, you better stay at home.

04:36.000 --> 04:38.000
But I'm a guard just like you.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.000
Yeah, I'm a guard just like you.

04:40.000 --> 04:42.000
I'm a guard just like you.

04:42.000 --> 04:44.000
I'm a guard just like you.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.000
I'm a guard just like you.

04:46.000 --> 04:48.000
I'm a guard just like you.

04:48.000 --> 04:52.000
Yes, but you're not a proper guard like me.

04:52.000 --> 04:54.000
Oh, okay then.

04:54.000 --> 04:55.000
Bye.

04:55.000 --> 04:56.000
Bye.

04:56.000 --> 04:57.000
Hello, Queen.

04:57.000 --> 04:58.000
Oh, hello.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.000
The number you have dialed has been disconnected.

05:01.000 --> 05:02.000
Hey, what?

05:02.000 --> 05:03.000
Bingo, come here.

05:03.000 --> 05:04.000
Bingo, come here.

05:04.000 --> 05:07.000
I made an omelette for Dad, but I didn't make it the right way.

05:07.000 --> 05:08.000
Red, what happened?

05:08.000 --> 05:10.000
Did you make it in time?

05:10.000 --> 05:11.000
Yes, I did.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
What happened?

05:12.000 --> 05:14.000
The Queen is having a bad time.

05:14.000 --> 05:16.000
I didn't make it the right way.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Really?

05:17.000 --> 05:18.000
Yeah.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.000
I need your help making another one.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.000
Okay.

05:21.000 --> 05:23.000
Is that an omelette I can smell?

05:23.000 --> 05:24.000
Get back upstairs!

05:24.000 --> 05:25.000
It is!

05:25.000 --> 05:26.000
Can I just...

05:26.000 --> 05:27.000
No, this isn't for you.

05:27.000 --> 05:28.000
What?

05:28.000 --> 05:29.000
Well, who's it for?

05:29.000 --> 05:30.000
You go.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.000
I'll take care of Dad.

05:31.000 --> 05:32.000
Please.

05:32.000 --> 05:33.000
I need food.

05:44.000 --> 06:13.000
Maybe I could eat this plant.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.000
Plant?

06:14.000 --> 06:15.000
Happy birthday!

06:15.000 --> 06:16.000
Is that food?

06:16.000 --> 06:17.000
Sure is!

06:17.000 --> 06:18.000
I made you an omelette.

06:18.000 --> 06:19.000
Give it here!

06:19.000 --> 06:20.000
Stand back, Bingo.

06:20.000 --> 06:21.000
You might lose a finger.

06:21.000 --> 06:22.000
Did you like it?

06:22.000 --> 06:23.000
Bingo, I'm going to be completely honest.

06:23.000 --> 06:24.000
That was the best omelette I've ever had in my life.

06:24.000 --> 06:25.000
Yay!

06:25.000 --> 06:26.000
Can I have another one?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.000
Yes!

06:27.000 --> 06:28.000
Let me clean this up.

06:28.000 --> 06:56.000
I think there are a few egg shells in that omelette.

06:56.000 --> 06:59.000
Well, you can't make an omelette without breaking a few...

06:59.000 --> 07:00.000
We'll clean it up!

07:00.000 --> 07:01.000
...eggs.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.000
That was so fun!

07:03.000 --> 07:04.000
Thanks for watching.

07:04.000 --> 07:05.000
I'll see you next time.

07:05.000 --> 07:05.000
