00:00.000 --> 00:23.000
Signing night, holding night, all is calm, all is bright.

00:23.000 --> 00:40.000
Round young virgin mother and child, holy infant, so tender and mild.

00:40.000 --> 00:56.000
Sleeping only, sleeping only, sleeping only, sleeping.

00:57.000 --> 01:14.000
Signing night, holding night, shape is clear at the sight.

01:14.000 --> 01:22.000
Glory is streamed from heaven, a fall.

01:22.000 --> 01:30.000
Heavenly, all sing how they live here.

01:30.000 --> 01:39.000
Christ, the Savior is born.

01:39.000 --> 01:46.000
Christ, the Savior is born.

02:09.000 --> 02:38.000
Holy Spirit, the Savior is born.

02:38.000 --> 02:55.000
Signing night, holding night, sun of God, old of pure life.

02:56.000 --> 03:12.000
Rain and beans from my old faith, with her dawn are reading the ring.

03:12.000 --> 03:24.000
Jesus, Lord, that birth, Jesus, Lord, that birth,

03:24.000 --> 03:37.000
Jesus, Lord, that birth, Jesus, Lord, that birth.
