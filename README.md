# Hello World Whisper

## Notes

- Not sure how to put this into pyproject.toml or if using hatch affects it but for the Python bindings to whisper.cpp you need to `pip install git+https://github.com/o4dev/whispercpp.py` which you can do `hatch shell` to make a venv for first, then just manually install
